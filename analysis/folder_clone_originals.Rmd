This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
origs = read.csv("/data/dejavuii/full/folderCloneOriginals.csv", sep=",")
#origWeights = read.csv("/data/dejavuii/full/folderClonesWeights.csv")
#projects = read.csv("/data/dejavuii/full/projects.csv")
#projects$url = paste0("http://github.com/", projects$user, "/", projects$repo)
#data = merge(origs, origsWeights, by.x = "X.id", by.y = "X.cloneId")
#data = merge(data, projects, by.x = "projectId", by.y = "X.id")
```
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
