Previous step: join
Next step: npm-summary

The verify phase verifies the project structure (i.e. all files deletes were seen added, all commits have their parents present, etc.), which checks for downloader errors. 

Furthermore, it excludes any projects where there are commits that do not satisfy that time of child commit is greater or equal the time of any of its parents. 

Here is the commandline and output (at commit `30bca23ae16aa6c504ec1b0997b2f2b762f0c826`):

```
peta@prl1e:~/devel/dejavuii/build$ time ./dejavu verify -d=/data/dejavuii/data -o=/data/dejavuii/data-verified -n=40
OH HAI CAN I HAZ DEJAVU AGAINZ?
